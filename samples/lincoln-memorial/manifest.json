    "description": "# Lincoln Memorial — Seated Statue of Abraham Lincoln\n\nHigh-resolution metrology-grade 3D scan of the monumental seated statue of [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln), the 16th President of the United States, located within the [Lincoln Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial) on the western end of the [National Mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall) in Washington, D.C.\n\n## History\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial was designed by architect [Henry Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bacon) and constructed between 1914 and 1922. The seated figure of Lincoln was sculpted by [Daniel Chester French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Chester_French) and carved by the [Piccirilli Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccirilli_Brothers) from 28 blocks of white [Georgia marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_marble). The statue stands 19 feet (5.8 m) tall from head to foot and 19 feet wide, and would be 28 feet tall if the figure were standing.\n\n## Significance\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on May 30, 1922, with [Robert Todd Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Todd_Lincoln), the president's only surviving son, in attendance. It has since become an iconic symbol of American democracy and was the site of [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.)'s [\"I Have a Dream\" speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream) on August 28, 1963, during the [March on Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom).\n\nThe memorial is administered by the [National Park Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service) and was listed on the [National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places) on October 15, 1966.\n\n## Scan Details\n\nThis archive contains a metrology-grade terrestrial laser scan and photogrammetric capture of the seated figure, including:\n\n- **Gaussian splat** reconstruction for photorealistic visualization\n- **Mesh** geometry derived from structured-light scanning for dimensional analysis\n- Sub-millimeter accuracy verified against physical control points\n- Full color calibration using X-Rite ColorChecker targets\n\n## Condition Notes\n\nThe statue shows minor surface soiling consistent with its age and indoor exposure. Hairline cracks are present in several marble blocks, most notably along the left arm rest and at two block seams on the torso. These are documented in the annotations. The [2011 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Virginia_earthquake) damage repairs to the memorial structure are visible at the ceiling but did not affect the statue itself."
